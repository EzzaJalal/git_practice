Title: Things That Feel Illegal… But Aren’t

Walking out of a store without buying anything
Holding scissors while walking (even if you’re being careful!)
Watching someone type their password and accidentally memorizing it
Using the staff bathroom at a friend’s workplace like you belong there
Closing a fridge with your foot like a ninja
Reading shampoo bottles in the shower like it’s serious literature
Saying “you too” when the waiter says “enjoy your meal” 
Looking at the ceiling during a test just to “recall” the answer
Eating cereal at 11 PM like you’re breaking a sacred food law
Making eye contact with someone through the peephole
Peeling the sticker off fruit before the cashier scans it 
Being the only one walking in the opposite direction at a crowded mall
Turning off WiFi to see if your siblings panic
