Title: Old Dusty Mirror
In a quiet village, a boy found an old, dusty mirror in his attic. 
Curious, he cleaned it—and saw not his reflection, but a version of himself ten years into the future, smiling and holding a book. 
The next day, he searched the local library and found that same book: "The Inventor's Journal." 
Inspired, he read it cover to cover, began building small gadgets, and a decade later, became a world-famous inventor. 
He never figured out how the mirror worked—but he never stopped believing it had shown him who he could become.



Title: The Last Voicemail
Sara moved into her new apartment and noticed something odd—her landline phone blinked with a voicemail. Curious, she played it.
A shaky voice whispered, “Don’t trust the man in the green jacket. He’s not who he says he is.”
Sara laughed it off—probably left by the previous tenant. But the next day, while walking to the grocery store, a man in a green jacket smiled and held the door open for her. He introduced himself as her neighbor… friendly, harmless.
That night, another voicemail appeared. “He knows you heard it. Get out now.”
Sara froze. She hadn't told anyone. Not even her mom.
The phone rang.
She picked it up.
Silence… then the same whisper: “He’s behind you.”

Sara dropped the phone. Her heart pounded as she turned around—nothing. Just her living room, dimly lit and silent.
She laughed nervously, “Okay, I’m officially losing it.”
Just to be safe, she locked every window and double-bolted the door. Then, with a kitchen knife under her pillow, she tried to sleep.
At 2:13 a.m., a click echoed from the hallway. The sound of her apartment door unlocking.
She grabbed her phone to call the police—but it was dead. No battery, though it was fully charged an hour ago.
The door creaked open.
Footsteps. Slow, heavy.
She slid under her bed, trembling.
A voice spoke from the living room. Calm. Cold.
“I warned you, Sara. But you stayed.”
Suddenly, the landline phone—disconnected for days—rang once.
Then silence.
Sara held her breath.
Ring.
A note slid under the bedroom door.
One word, handwritten:
RUN.

Sara’s pulse thundered in her ears. She stared at the note: RUN. Her hands shook as she backed toward the window, but then—another sound. Not footsteps this time.
Breathing. From the other side of her bedroom door.
She clutched the knife, heart thudding. The doorknob turned… once. Twice. Click. Locked. For now.
She slipped out the window onto the fire escape. Below, the alley was dark and slick with rain. As she climbed down, a voice echoed softly from her room—her voice.
“Help me…”
Sara stopped cold. How was that her voice?
She ran. Sprinting through the alley, she reached the street and flagged down a taxi. Barely inside, she gasped, “Just drive!”
The driver didn’t say a word. Just nodded and pulled away.
But after a few blocks, something felt wrong. The city lights blurred. Streets looked unfamiliar.
Sara leaned forward. “Where are we—?”
The driver turned slowly, revealing a pale face and green jacket.
He smiled.
“You never should’ve answered that voicemail.”

Sara’s blood turned to ice.
She reached for the door handle—but it was jammed shut. Locked from the inside.
The man in the green jacket stared ahead, calm as ever. "It's not personal," he said. "You were just the next one to find it."
“Find what?!” she cried.
He didn’t answer.
The taxi suddenly screeched to a halt outside a rundown motel in the middle of nowhere. He turned to her, held up a small black cassette tape, and placed it in her hand. "You’re part of it now," he whispered, and vanished into the rain, leaving her alone.
Sara stumbled inside the motel, dazed. The power flickered. The receptionist was gone.
She found a dusty recorder in the lounge. Hands trembling, she played the tape.
Her voice came through—calm, but eerily flat:
“If you’re hearing this… it’s already too late. The voicemails don’t come from a person. They come from it. It watches, it listens, it follows. The green jacket? Just one of its faces.”
“There’s only one rule: Never answer the phone after midnight.”
Sara dropped the recorder.
Behind her… the lobby phone rang.

12:01 a.m.

She didn’t move. Didn’t blink.
But the phone wouldn’t stop ringing.
With one last breath, she picked it up.
“Hello?”
A familiar voice replied.
“…Sara? It’s you. Don’t trust the girl at the motel. She’s not who she says she is.”
She turned toward the hallway mirror.
And saw herself… standing behind her… but not moving.
Not blinking.
Not real.
