THE LIST:

Milk (lactose-free, not the blue cap, the red one—very important!)

Eggs (organic, from happy chickens only)

Bread (multigrain, but not too seedy—Dad’s dentures can’t handle that)

Toothpaste (the minty one, not the spicy one, you know the one)

Avocados (not too hard, not too soft, perfectly ripe... good luck)

Shampoo (lavender-scented, the one with the purple label but not the “new formula” one, that one sucks)

Cat food (Tuna flavor ONLY, or Whiskers will throw a tantrum)

Batteries (AA, AAA, and the weird flat one that goes in the kitchen clock)

Birthday card for Grandma (but funny, not sappy)

Lemons (but only if they’re not bruised like last time)

Baking soda (for fridge smell, not baking—two different kinds apparently)

3 onions (but they have to feel right)

A pineapple (just one. Don't ask.)

Socks for Dad (black, ankle-length, no logos—he’s VERY specific)

Ice cream (whichever is on sale, unless it’s mint. Never mint.)

Toilet paper (the soft kind—Mom said last time felt like sandpaper)

Frozen peas (for cooking AND emergency sprained ankle therapy)

Cereal (not too healthy but also not dessert—balance is key)

Hand soap (refill pack, jasmine-scented or civil war will break out)

Light bulbs (warm tone, not interrogation room white)

Cleaning spray (lemony, toxic to germs but kind to souls)

Peanut butter (smooth for Mom, crunchy for Dad, war for Sara)

Dish sponge (with the scrubby green side—yellow alone is betrayal)

Scented candles (calm vanilla, not "mystical ocean breeze" that smells like sadness)

Air freshener (vanilla or pine—nothing that says “chemical warfare”)

Toothpicks (apparently they now come in flavors?? Get a sample pack)

Chocolate (as reward for surviving this list)

Patience (not sold in-store, sadly)...haha
